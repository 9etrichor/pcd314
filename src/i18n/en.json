  "news1": "In 2024, a new 314 protocol technology emerged, revolutionizing traditional on-chain DEX contract trading methods. It achieved decentralized peer-to-peer transactions with simple interactions, requiring no authorization of any contracts. Users buying simply transfer BNB to the contract, and selling involves transferring PCD314, eliminating the need for any SWAP transactions. This significantly lowered the barrier for ordinary users to enter Web 3.0, further promoting the prosperity of the blockchain industry. The Singapore Foundation and PCD public chain reached a consensus on cooperation in ecological construction, utilizing 314 protocol technology to incubate new ecological applications. (See PCD314 white paper for ecological planning.)",
